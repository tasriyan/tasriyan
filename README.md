## Hey there, I'm Tatyana (Tanya) ðŸ‘‹

**Senior .NET Developer | Systems Architect**

I build tools that address real pain points I've experienced as a tech lead and systems architect. Most of my repositories solve problems I got tired of dealing with manually.

### Currently working on
- Developer productivity tools for enterprise environments
- AI agents that might actually be useful (built with Python - a nice break from .NET)
- Legacy system integration helpers

### My approach
Business value > technical purity. I take a pragmatic approach to modernizing legacy applications rather than full-rewrite, big bang approaches. My tools are built for other tech leads facing similar challenges with legacy code and weak development teams.

### When I'm not coding
ðŸŽ¨ Occasional art projects  
ðŸŒ± Gardening (I'd rather be debugging plants than debugging legacy code, I tell you that!)
