**Systems Architect**

I've worked as a systems architect in enterprise environments long enough to know the common pain points: my libraries are "guardrail architecture" - designed to improve code reliability and reduce boilerplate.
With these tools I hope I can help other tech leads facing challenges with legacy code or weak development teams.

### Featured Projects

<img src="./.github/assets/propel-flags3.png" width="46" height="46" align="center"/> **[Propel Feature Flags Platform](https://github.com/Treiben)** 

Complete, self-hosted feature flag system for .NET
- **[Propel Dashboard](https://github.com/Treiben/propel-dashboard)** - Web UI for managing flags (React + .NET, single Docker container)
- **[Propel .NET SDK](https://github.com/Treiben/propel-feature-flags-csharp)** - Type-safe feature flags (.NET Framework 4.7.2 through .NET 9)
- **[Propel CLI](https://github.com/Treiben/propel-cli)** - Command-line management and CI/CD automation

*Philosophy:* Strongly-typed flags that auto-deploy from code. No magic strings, no config drift. Multiple evaluation modes, legacy framework support, single deployment step.

<img src="./.github/assets/knara-lyre12.png" width="46" height="46" align="center"/> **[Knara Libraries](https://github.com/tasriyan)**

Production-ready utilities that enforce best practices at compile-time
- **[Knara.UtcStrict](https://github.com/tasriyan/Knara.UtcStrict)** - Forces UTC DateTime usage to prevent timezone bugs
- Other Knara packages: Tenant isolation, source generators, enterprise patterns

### Currently working on
- Feature flag platform expansion (TypeScript and Java SDKs coming)
- AI agents that might actually be useful (built with Python - a nice break from .NET)
- Developer productivity tools for enterprise environments

### When I'm not coding
ðŸŽ¨ Occasional art projects  
ðŸŒ± Gardening (I'd rather be debugging plants than debugging legacy code, I tell you that!)
