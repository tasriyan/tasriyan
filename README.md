## Hey there, I'm Tatyana (Tanya) ðŸ‘‹

**Systems Architect**

I build tools that address real pain points I've experienced as a tech lead and systems architect. Most of my repositories solve problems I got tired of dealing with manually.

### Currently working on
- Developer productivity tools for enterprise environments
- AI agents that might actually be useful (built with Python - a nice break from .NET)
- Legacy system integration helpers

My repositories are tools I hope can help other tech leads facing challenges with legacy code or weak development teams.

### When I'm not coding
ðŸŽ¨ Occasional art projects  
ðŸŒ± Gardening (I'd rather be debugging plants than debugging legacy code, I tell you that!)
